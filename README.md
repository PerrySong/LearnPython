| Operator |	Name |	Description |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| a + b	| Addition |	Sum of a and b |
| a - b |	Subtraction	| Difference of a and b |
| a * b	| Multiplication |	Product of a and b |
| a / b	| True division	| Quotient of a and b |
| a // b |	Floor division |	Quotient of a and b, removing fractional parts |

## Order of operations
## PEMDAS - Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction.

## Builtin functions for working with number

```python
  min(1, 3) # 1
  max(1, 3) # 3
  abs(32) # 32
  abs(-32) # 32
```
## Conversion

```python
  print(float(10)) # 10.0
  print(int(3.33)) # 3
  # They can even be called on strings!
  print(int('807') + 1) # 808
```
